\title{Bayesian estimation of heteroskedastic Structural Vector Autoregressions with 
Markov-switching structural matrix}
\description{
Efficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressions 
with Stochastic Volatility heteroskedasticity and Markov-switching structural matrix. The models
were developed for a paper Camehl, Annika & Woźniak, Tomasz (2022) What do Data Say About 
Time-Variation in Monetary Policy Shock Identification?
}
\details{
All the SVAR models in this package are specified by two equations, including 
the reduced form equation:
\deqn{Y = AX + E}
where \eqn{Y} is an \code{NxT} matrix of dependent variables, 
\eqn{X} is a \code{KxT} matrix of explanatory variables, 
\eqn{E} is an \code{NxT} matrix of reduced form error terms, 
and \eqn{A} is an \code{NxK} matrix of autoregressive slope coefficients and 
parameters on deterministic terms in \eqn{X}.

The structural equation is given by:
\deqn{B(s_t, kappa(s_t))E = U}
where \eqn{U} is an \code{NxT} matrix of structural form error terms, and
\eqn{B} is an \code{NxN} matrix of contemporaneous relationships.

Finally, all of the models share the following assumptions regarding the structural
shocks \code{U}, namely, joint conditional normality given the past observations collected
in matrix \code{X}, and temporal and contemporaneous independence. The latter implies 
zero correlations and autocorrelations.
